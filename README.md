# Minotaur
C++ ECS Game Engine using OSG and CEGUI. Implementations of several ideas from *Game Coding Complete*, *Game Programming Gems* and others.


## Install

Just set the correct paths to `OpenSceneGraph` and `CEGUI` in `CMakeLists.txt`, hit `cmake && make`, and the thing should compile. Note that those are only libraries.
